- Doors on first floor. Pushed inside the wall using interior mapping too?
- Custom textures (pixel art? hand painted?).
- Fix different texture size between left/right walls and back wall.
- Cleanup shader code (macros ?).
- Bake all the textures in a sprite sheet to avoid having too many textures?
